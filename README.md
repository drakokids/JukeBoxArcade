# Juke Box Arcade

It's not only a Juke Box, but it's also a multimedia arcade.

 Why another Juke Box?

### Why another jukebox?

Just because there are no jukebox with games included, specially my games :-)

### Why Windows?

Because it's easier ( it can be also easily converted to linux or mac ).

Everybody have an old computer with windows to use as jukebox.

To play videos in 4K or 8K it's more powerfull than linux and cheaper than mac.

### Why Pascal ?

Because it's the language where I have more experience, and it's faster to build.

Again, to play videos and sound, there are a lot of libraries and good ones for what we need.

### What will be included?

To start only the basics, but in the end I pretend to have this as a full application.
